    question: "What is StampNet?",
    answer: "StampNet is a decentralized timestamping platform that allows users to prove document existence at a specific time using blockchain technology.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does blockchain-based timestamping work?",
    answer: "When you upload a document, StampNet generates a cryptographic hash and stores it on the blockchain, ensuring an immutable record of its existence.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is my document stored on the blockchain?",
    answer: "No, only the hash of your document is stored on the blockchain, ensuring privacy while proving authenticity.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I verify a previously timestamped document?",
    answer: "Yes, you can upload your document to StampNet, and it will check the hash against the blockchain records.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is StampNet free to use?",
    answer: "StampNet may have gas fees associated with blockchain transactions, but basic verification features could be free.",
  },
